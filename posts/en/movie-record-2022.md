# Movies Watched in 2022

- Constantine
  - _This movie made me truly quit smoking._

- Nope
  - _Jordan Peele's classic racial themes plus a lament for Hollywood's decline._
- Hawkeye
- Jumper
  - _The superpower I dreamed of as a child - traveling the world without taking planes would be wonderful._
- Triangle of Sadness
  - _When a woman gains power, she also becomes domineering and possessive of attractive men. When humans are in certain positions, they naturally exhibit instinctive behaviors regardless of gender. This is humanity's tragedy._
- God's Crooked Lines
  - _I pretended to be mentally ill to enter a psychiatric hospital for investigation, but ended up having to prove my sanity. The last ten seconds of the film tell me I am indeed mentally ill._
- Avatar: The Way of Water
  - _Colonial countries still love to repent. Can't help it - audiences love to watch._

- Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery
  - _A rare film that surpasses its predecessor._
- R.I.P.D.
- Enola Holmes 2
- Decision to Leave
  - _Park Chan-wook's cinematography is poetically beautiful. Tang Wei perfectly portrays that suppressed love. "The best way to destroy a man is to become part of him, then disappear from this world."_
- Remember
  - _A qualified product from South Korea's revenge film assembly line._
- Black Adam
- Confidential Assignment 2: International

  - _A sci-fi film from twenty years ago, the father-son relationship is touching._
- Strange Tales
  - _Domestic sci-fi film, the third story is terrifying upon reflection._
- A Simple Favor
  - _A woman who appears harmless, helpful, and bullied versus one who built her own business and could kill her own sister - the former is more ruthless. Men become playthings in the film._
- Werewolf by Night
- The Hunt
  - _Lee Jung-jae's directorial debut, surprisingly good. Also lamenting that the Chun Doo-hwan era is truly an inexhaustible source of stories for Korean cinema._
- Bullet Train
  - _Star-studded action comedy. Incidentally, the director was once Brad Pitt's stunt double. Also, "Five Hundred Miles" sounds great._
- Top Gun: Maverick
  - _American military recruitment propaganda, but it really got my blood pumping. Tom Cruise is still so handsome._
- Thor: Love and Thunder
  - _You can tell Marvel's Phase Four just wants to slack off, but it does serve as a bridge. The cosmic entities "Eternity" and "Living Tribunal" introduced in the film are anticipated to have larger roles in Phase Five._

  - _Watched both the first and second with Momo, miss 4399 mini-games and Jim Carrey haha._
