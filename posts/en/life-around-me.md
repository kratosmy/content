Today's Bing wallpaper changed to a school of barracuda, circling round and round, which made me think about my own life.

As I approach thirty, I increasingly feel that life has "reached its end," and every day ahead is just a repetition of some day in the past.

My parents still care about whether I eat healthily and whether work is tiring;

When I come home, the topics I discuss with my wife seem to have been talked about on some day in the past. No matter where we travel, the scenery all looks the same to me;

When gathering with friends, although we eat different dishes, they all taste the same in my mouth. We still talk about the past, then laugh it off with sighs.

I changed jobs, and the colleagues around me changed, but they still look like the same group of people - some introverted, some extroverted, some sincere and kind, some hypocritical and gloomy. The younger ones love playing board games, while the older ones worry themselves gray over their families;

...

Life is like a spiraling circle, with the central axis being the length of life, but the width often remains unchanged. Each circle can almost be projected onto the same circle.

But fortunately, I have a child. She adds countless possibilities to my unchanging life. This is a kind of happiness, and perhaps this is one of the meanings of human reproduction.

You might think I'm expressing pessimism, but there's nothing wrong with an unchanging life. I hope those happy days with family can continue to spiral around life's central axis unchanged, until the very end.
