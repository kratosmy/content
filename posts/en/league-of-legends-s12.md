# S12

Regarding the final championship, I don't know why most people hoped for SKT to win and for Faker to return to his peak. I particularly hoped for DRX to win because my mood while watching the match yesterday was the same as in 2017 S7, just like I mentioned in my first blog post:

## Deft

He and Faker were both students at Mapo High School, both went professional in the same year, yet over ten years he moved through seven teams without ever winning a championship.

Deft also played for EDG before, and coincidentally Clearlove was on the commentary desk that day. I wonder what he was thinking, being both a fellow dreamer and former teammate.

Perhaps he had already come to terms with it - never winning a championship in one's lifetime is actually the norm. At least having tried hard leaves no regrets.

During the post-match interview, Deft said something I think is worth recording:

> _"The only thing I'm good at is League of Legends. If I can't succeed at what I'm best at, then I have no idea what meaning my life has."_
